\emph
{reasonable}
means
it
behaves
as
one
expect.
For
example,
in
the
category
of
rings,
an
epimorphism
may
not
be
a
surjective
homomorphism,
see
(c)
of
\ref
{prob
2.5};
in
the
category
of
fields,
an
injective
homomorphism
is
a
split
monomorphism
if
and
only
if
it
is
an
isomorphism,
which
is
too
restricted.
